- **Alternate description** :
  > "Wuffle is a wolf with a big heart. Currently, he's living as a farmer in a barn that is on a hill near Gingerbread Village. He never turns away from people who needs a helping hand. He is also willing to help them out not expecting anything in return. However **Wuffle** tends to be naive and too trusting which often brings him unexpected trouble."
