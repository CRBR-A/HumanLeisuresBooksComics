# Wuffle-comic

**Author** : Piti Yindee   
*A feel-good comic series that will make you laugh out loud, brighten up your day, and make you smile. It bring back the old charms of the good' old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young.*  

"**Wuffle** is a wolf with a big heart. Currently, he's living as a farmer in a barn that is on a hill near Gingerbread Village. He never turns away from people who needs a helping hand. He is also willing to help them out not expecting anything in return. However **Wuffle** tends to be naive and too trusting which often brings him unexpected trouble."
